# JaaG (JSON as a Game)

Instead of building a Résumé-as-a-Game (as I originally planned), I will take the easier route and build a full-out game 'engine'. 

I say 'engine'... but that's a little strong. I will define a list of possibilities, actions, roles, etc. Then, a game can be created with nothing but a JSON configuration file (a BIG configuration file). 

I will keep the `game_config.js` template here for reference.

```js
{
  'hello': 'world'
}
```
