THIS SPACE USED FOR NOTES TO MYSELF BETWEEN COMMITS (INSTEAD OF MAKING ISSUES)

Next on the list is to make more than just the hero fall. `move_set` should become `move_set` 
and contain all objects that are affected by gravity. 

Actually, because move_set has to be set to scroll_set, move_set becomes full_set (it's a bug).
So I'll use an attribute to determine gravity. 

I need a place to track progress before bothering with content:
- [x] css movement
- [x] object config
- [x] object intersection
- [x] hero jumping
- [x] hero falling 
- [ ] object falling
- [x] holes (nvm- just make floor scroll)
- [ ] NPCs
  - [ ] movement (auto)
  - [ ] intersection
  - [ ] kill npc
  - [ ] kill hero
- [ ] add pushable possibility to moveable objects
- [ ] event triggers (button press, etc)
- [ ] levels
  - [ ] separation of levels
  - [ ] hero reset on death to beginning of level
